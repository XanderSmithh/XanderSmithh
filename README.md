My name is Xander. I'm a recent Diploma of Advanced Programming graduate, and I enjoy working on C# projects as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project called [MyReads](https://github.com/XanderSmithh/MyReads). It’s a WPF application designed to help to store Records allowing me to extend my skills in databases and, in the future, advanced search engines.
